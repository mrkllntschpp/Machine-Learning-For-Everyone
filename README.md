## Credits

The ``Machine Learning for Everyone`` was originally conceived by Mark Tschopp, and has been developed over time based on lots and lots and lots of feedback from others. 
Thanks to everyone who has given me feedback along the way, sticking with me even though I am not the foremost expert on Machine Learning.
