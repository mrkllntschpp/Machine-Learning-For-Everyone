# Machine Learning for Everyone: May The Fourth Be With You

Welcome to the "Machine Learning for Everyone: May The Fourth Be With You" course materials repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of course materials designed to provide an entry point into the exciting world of machine learning, all with a Star Wars twist. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refresh your knowledge, this course aims to make machine learning concepts accessible and engaging.

## Introduction

Why should you spend time learning about machine learning from someone who just started down this path a few years ago? 

Great question. Thank you for asking! Well, first off, maybe because I was like you a few months back. I vividly remember the process of learning machine learning, the intuition, the concepts, and the math. It's fresh in my mind, allowing me to provide insights into what concepts are essential and how they connect.

To structure the course, I listed what I consider key machine learning concepts: regression, classification, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, variance-bias tradeoff, loss/cost functions, activation functions, neural networks, dropout, convolutional neural networks, LSTMs, and more. I built a slide deck around these concepts, hoping for one slide per concept (which, I must admit, I miserably failed at). Nevertheless, the slide deck provides a comprehensive entry point into the world of machine learning.

And guess what? Since I am an Army scientist, I chose an Army-related dataset to work with—ballistic penetration of armor. Well, upon second thought, all datasets were transformed into Star Wars-related datasets for this course—just because. No cat classification datasets or Boston housing price datasets here. Instead, we dive into the fascinating world of bullets being stopped by armor, all with a touch of Star Wars.

I condensed seven months of online machine learning courses into a few sessions, carefully selecting the most relevant topics. I organized the course into three modules: machine learning basics, neural network basics, and neural network zoo. But wait, there's more! I added a few additional topics to cover a wider range of machine learning concepts. It's not everything, but it's a good start.

Throughout my journey, I've had the pleasure of teaching this virtual short course on machine learning to thousands of people over the last few years. The positive feedback and enthusiasm from learners have motivated me to continue sharing my knowledge and insights with the wider community.

May the fourth be with you as you embark on this machine learning adventure!

## Repository Information

This repository was created to host the course materials that I developed for the Machine Learning for Everyone virtual course that I have taught. In fact, there was a great article about this [^1^] from Year 1, with me in a Jedi costume to boot!

## Coming Soon!

- **One Minute Machine Learning: For the 'Somewhat Familiar' with ML Crowd**: A book based on the successful course is currently in progress. Stay tuned for bite-sized insights into machine learning concepts!

## Register for the Next Course

- **Next "ML-4-Everyone: May The Fourth Be With You" Course in 2024**: Join us for the next edition of the course in 2024. Don't miss out on the opportunity to dive into machine learning with a Star Wars twist.  Wait, what? It falls on a Saturday!?!? Don't worry, we'll have this either before or after or both! 
- No other upcoming courses scheduled at the moment.
